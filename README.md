# gyroROBOTTOUR
Custom GyroLibrary

This project aims to use the GYRO Sensor in many aspects of the Robot Tour Event in the Science Olympiad. Science Olympiad's Robot Tour is a robotic-dedicated event that uses a robot to navigate
through a 4x4 block maze. With many obstacles and gates, the robot has to reach the endpoint on time (neither late nor early), reach accurately close to the point, and pass through gates to minimize
points to get the lowest score possible.


Giving a retrospective view of this repository, I have combined many gyro files for angle navigation, proper PID algorithm tuning, and my Robot Tour Maze-solving files.
